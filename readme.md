## What is this?

A full-stack personal project "DANG! That's Delishh" made using @wesbos tutorials.

### What did I use to make it

I used node.js for the backend, mongoDB as the database and pug for templating. 

### Some of the challenges I faced

Even though the tutorials were hella helpful and direct, I tried implementing most of the backend tid-bits myself. I particularly faced a challenge implementing the password-reset flow which got pretty hairy at certain times but turned out to be kinda straightforward after I got the hang of it. Also, monogoDB relations took some time to wrap my head around but after some head-scratching and going through the docs, it cleared up and I got the hang of it. 

### Things I learnt

This project mostly displays my backend skills/knowledge. I believe it showcases skills like (but not limited to) user auth, routing, pagination, mongodb aggregations, mvc patterns, middlewares, async-await, google maps api, handling mail (using nodejs), etc.

### What's next

Even though this project was a really healthy way to get started on node, I believe that there is much to learn and will be exploring other node functionalities like streams, websockets, etc

### I dont like this piece of tech you used
